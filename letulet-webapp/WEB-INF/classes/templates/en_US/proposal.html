<h2>ADDENDUM TO RESIDENTIAL TENANCY AGREEMENT</h2>

<p>This Addendum to Residential Tenancy Agreement ("Addendum") is entered into between [$AGREEMENT_LANDLORD_NAME$] (" Landlord") and [$AGREEMENT_TENANT_NAME$] ("Resident") and is made a part of the residential rental agreement ("the Rental Agreement") between Landlord and Resident for the residential rental unit located at [$AGREEMENT_PROPERTY_ADDRESS$] ("Premises"),</p>

<p>The Rental Agreement now includes the following terms:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> SHORT-TERM RENTALS:  Subject to the terms and conditions herein,<br/>
Resident may list the Premises on short-term rental sites ("STRS"), such as AirBNB, and host paying guests using STRS, subject to the terms of this Addendum.  Any attempt to list the Premises or enter into any rental using a STRS other than as permitted under this Addendum shall be null and void, and shall constitute a material default by Resident under the Rental Agreement.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> LANDLORD COMPENSATION:  Resident agrees and acknowledges that short term subletting creates additional risks and costs for the Landlord and that Landlord would not enter into this Addendum but for the  service provided by LetULet to manage those risks and the compensation to Landlord for those costs.   Accordingly, Resident agrees to pay Landlord [$AGREEMENT_LANDLORD_COMMISSION$]% of all gross payouts from hosting short term rentals as defined as the payout paid after deduction of any applicable fees and taxes (including business registration fees and licensing, service fees, insurance and transient occupancy/hotel taxes) and cleaning fee as established in the listing on the STRS for the Premises.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> INDEMNIFICATION: Resident agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless LetuLet and Landlord from and against any and all third party claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses arising from: (i) Resident's use of and access to AirBNB.com and LetULet; (ii) Resident's violation of any term of this Addendum or any applicable federal, state or local law, regulation; (iii) Resident's violation of any third party right, including without limitation any civil rights, copyright, property, or privacy right; (iv) any claim that any of the content posted or inputted by Resident on any site or application that caused damage to a third party; (v) any claim for injury or loss by any guest of Tenant occurring in the Rental Unit or Building, unless caused by Landlord's gross negligence of willful conduct; and  (vi) any claims to tenancy rights by third-parties.</p>

<p>This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Addendum and Resident's use of<br/>
LetULet services.  Resident shall have a duty to defend Landlord and LetuLet against such claims, and extends to requiring Resident to pay for Landlord and LetULet's reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, settlements and disbursements.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> LEGAL COMPLIANCE:  Resident shall comply with all applicable laws and governmental regulations, including those prohibiting discrimination, and all applicable laws and regulations related to hosting paying guests through a STRS now or hereafter effected in the state, county, city and locality where the Premises is located (collectively "Applicable Laws").  It is Resident's sole responsibility to understand and to comply with all laws that apply, or may apply in future, to their short- term rental activity, and it is not the responsibility of Landlord and or Letulet to insure that Resident is in compliance with Applicable Laws.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> USE OF LETULET PLATFORM: In consideration of, and as a condition precedent to, Landlord's willingness to permit Resident to host paying guests using STRS pursuant to this Addendum, Resident shall (i) exclusively use LetuLet to facilitate Landlord's management and monitoring of Short-term rental guests by Residents; and 2) agree to all terms and conditions set forth in the LetULet Agreement.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> REVOCATION RIGHTS: Resident acknowledges and agrees that the monitoring services provided by LetULet were a material inducement for Landlord to allow Resident to host paying guests using STRS at the Premises. Accordingly, this Addendum shall automatically terminate in the event that LetULet and or the Landlord suspends or cancels the LetULet account associated with Resident or if Resident terminates Resident's LetuLet account.   To the extent Landlord offered Resident the right to use LetULet at the inception of Resident's tenancy, the parties agree that revocation of the right to use LetULet will cause damage to Resident but that it will be impracticable or extremely difficult to fix the actual damage.  Therefore, Landlord and Resident agree that $[$AGREEMENT_SD$] per month represents a reasonable and fair estimate of the actual damage that would be sustained by Resident which Resident agrees to accept as rent credit.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> TERMS OF LEASE: Except as affected by the terms of this Addendum, all other terms of the Rental Agreement remain in full force and effect, including any and all prohibitions against subletting, assignment or other transfers contained in the Rental Agreement.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> MODIFICATION: LetUlet reserves the right to modify the Terms and Conditions of its service, the service fee, and its product offering and Resident agrees that Landlord may modify the terms of this Addendum. Resident will be informed of such changes by LetULet providing Resident thirty (30) days-written notice.  Resident agrees to accept service of said notice by electronic mail through Resident's LetULet account or as otherwise allowed by the jurisdiction in which the Premises is located.  If Resident disagrees with the modifications, Resident may terminate this Addendum with immediate effect.  The notice of modification will inform Resident about the right to terminate the Addendum in the notification email.  If Resident does not terminate this Addendum before the date the modifications become effective, Residents continued hosting through LetULet will constitute acceptance of the modifications.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Limits on Hosting: Resident agrees to abide by the following Hosting Limits set by Landlord when hosting short-term guests in the Premises:</p>

<p><b>10.1</b> OCCUPANCY LIMITS: Resident agrees that the total number of hosted guests shall not exceed [$AGREEMENT_MAXIMUM_GUESTS$] on any hosted day.</p>

<p><b>10.2</b> Total Days Booked per Year Limit : Resident agrees to not exceed [$AGREEMENT_MAXIMUM_DAYS$] number of days that the unit is hosted per calendar year.</p>

<p><b>10.3</b> Total Bookings per year limit:  Resident agrees not exceed [$AGREEMENT_MAXIMUM_BOOKING$] number of individual bookings per calendar year,</p>

<p>Or if checked here___ resident will not have a limit on hosting per calendar year.</p>

<p>11. HOUSE RULES:  Resident agrees to make their short-term rental guest aware of the  House Rules prior to that guest's booking, and unsure that the Guest abides by the House Rules during their stay. The House Rules are created by Landlord and published on LetULet.</p>
